# üë®‚Äçüíª To compile the application yourself:

### Windows and Linux Version build instructions:

### **Recommended Method: The Task Runner**

The new, preferred way to compile the application is by using the unified task runner script. This script handles everything for you, from setting up the environment to running the correct build process.

1.  Navigate to the `Windows_and_Linux` directory.
2.  Run the script for your OS:
    - **Windows:** `run.bat`
    - **Linux/macOS:** `./run.sh`
3.  From the interactive menu, choose either the "Development Build" or "Final Release Build".

Alternatively, you can run the build directly with a command:

- **Development Build:** `run.bat build-dev`
- **Final Build:** `run.bat build-final`

For a complete guide on using the task runner and the differences between the builds, **[see the new Development Workflow documentation.](./Development%20Workflow.md)**

### **Legacy Build Methods**

If you prefer to run the build steps manually, you can use the methods below.

**Direct Python Script Execution:**

Navigate to the `Windows_and_Linux` directory and run:

```bash
# For development build (faster, preserves settings)
python scripts/dev-build.py

# For final release build
python scripts/final-build.py
```

Both scripts automatically:

- Set up the virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Build the application with PyInstaller
- Copy required files

**Key Differences:**

- **Development build**: Preserves your existing configuration files (config.json) and launches the app automatically
- **Final build**: Creates a clean release version without user configurations, ready for distribution
