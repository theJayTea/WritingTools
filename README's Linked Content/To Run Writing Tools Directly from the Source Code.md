If you prefer to run the program directly from the `main.py` file, follow these OS-specific instructions.

**1. Download the Code**
- Click the green `<> Code ▼` button toward the very top of this page, and click `Download ZIP`.

**2. Install Dependencies**  
After extracting the folder, open your **Terminal** (or **Command Prompt**) in the relevant directory.

- Windows:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\Windows_and_Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- Linux:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Windows_and_Linux
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Of course, you'll need to have [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)!

**3. Run the Program**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
