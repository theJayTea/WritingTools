## Highlights

- **Truly native**: Built in Swift (SwiftUI + AppKit where helpful) for a crisp Mac experience.
- **Local LLMs with MLX**: Run models **fully on-device** on Apple Silicon. No internet required.
- **Rich Text Proofread**: Keep **RTF formatting** (bold, italics, lists, links) while fixing grammar and tone.
- **Your workflow, your rules**: Add/edit **custom commands** and assign your own **shortcuts**.
- **Multilingual**: App UI in **English, German, French, Spanish**; commands work with many more languages.
- **Themes**: Multiple themes including Dark Mode to match your desktop.

## Quick Start (Download & Install)

1) **Download** the latest `.dmg` from **Releases**:  
   https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases

2) **Install**  
   - Open the `.dmg`, drag **Writing Tools.app** into **Applications**.
   - On first open, if Gatekeeper warns, right-click the app → **Open**.

3) **Run**  
   - Launch the app.
   - Open **Settings** and choose your **AI Provider** (local MLX, Ollama, or a cloud provider).
   - Assign your preferred **keyboard shortcut**.

---

## First Launch: Permissions

Writing Tools uses macOS accessibility to read and replace selected text.  
On first run, grant:

- **Accessibility** (required)  
- **Screen Recording** (only needed for some apps that restrict text access)

You can manage these anytime under:  
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility / Screen Recording**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

> Tip: If replacement doesn’t work in a specific app, enabling **Screen Recording** usually fixes it.

---

## Using Writing Tools

- **Invoke anywhere**: Select text in any app → press your shortcut → choose an action:
  - **Proofread** (keeps RTF formatting)
  - **Rewrite**, **Make Friendly**, **Make Professional**, **Concise**
  - **Summarize**, **Key Points**, **Table**
  - **Custom command** (your own prompt)
- **No selection?** Your shortcut opens a quick **Chat** with the current model.
- **Undo**: If you don’t like the result, simply undo in the target app.

> Shortcut conflicts? Check **System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts** (Spotlight/Input Sources) and pick an alternative combo in the app’s Settings.

---

## Providers & Models

- **Cloud**: OpenAI, Google (Gemini), Anthropic, Mistral, OpenRouter  
- **Local**:
  - **MLX (Apple Silicon)** — first-class, on-device inference
  - **Ollama** via OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Bring your own API keys, switch providers anytime, and mix local + cloud based on your task.

---

## Power Features

- **Command Editor**: Create reusable buttons for your own prompts; assign per-command shortcuts.
- **Model Flexibility**: Choose the best model for proofreading vs. summarization vs. chat.
- **Localization**: UI in **EN / DE / FR / ES**; commands happily accept and output many languages.
- **Document-friendly**: **RTF-preserving Proofread** keeps the look of your document intact.

---

## System Requirements

- **macOS 14.0 or later** (due to Accessibility APIs used for selection/replacement). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Apple Silicon** recommended for MLX local models (runs on-device for privacy and speed).  
- For development: **Xcode 15+**.

## Build From Source (Xcode)

You can build the macOS app either by opening the project or the package:

**Option A — Open project (if present)**  
1. `git clone https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools.git`  
2. Open **WritingTools/macOS/** and double-click the **.xcodeproj**.  
3. Select target **Writing Tools** → **Signing & Capabilities** → choose your Development Team.  
4. Set **Deployment Target** to **macOS 14.0** (or higher).  
5. Run on **My Mac** (⌘R).

**Option B — Open the folder / Package.swift**  
1. `git clone https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools.git`  
2. In Xcode: **File → Open…** → choose **WritingTools/macOS** (or the repo root).  
3. Let Xcode resolve Swift Packages, then configure **Signing** and **Deployment Target** as above.  
4. Run on **My Mac** (⌘R).

> First debug run will trigger macOS permission prompts (Accessibility / Screen Recording). Accept them and relaunch if prompted. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Troubleshooting

- **Shortcut doesn’t trigger**  
  - Pick another combo in Settings (avoid Spotlight/Input Sources defaults).
- **Text not replaced in a specific app**  
  - Ensure **Accessibility** is allowed; enable **Screen Recording** for that app scenario.
- **Local model not responding**  
  - For **MLX**: confirm the model is available and selected in Settings.  
  - For **Ollama**: verify the server is running and the **Base URL / Model** fields match your local model name.
- **Permissions got reset**  
  - Remove and re-add the app under: **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

---

## Privacy

- Nothing is sent anywhere unless **you** invoke an action.
- API keys are stored **locally** on your device.
- Use **MLX** to keep all processing **on-device** (no network).
