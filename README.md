## ‚ú® What is Writing Tools?

Writing Tools is an **Apple Intelligence-inspired application for Windows, Linux, and macOS that supercharges your writing with an AI LLM** (cloud-based or local).

With one hotkey press system-wide, it lets you fix grammar, optimize text according to your instructions, summarize content (webpages, YouTube videos, etc.), and more.

It's currently the **world's most intelligent system-wide grammar assistant**, works in ~any language, and has been featured in üî• [**28+ global publications**](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/blob/main/Media%20Coverage.md) ([Beebom](https://beebom.com/high-schooler-app-brings-apple-inteligence-writing-tools-windows/), [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-pc-can-now-deliver-instant-free-writing-help-across-all-apps/), [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/if-you-like-apple-intelligences-writing-tool-try-this-open-source-app-as-its-windows-counterpart/), [Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-intelligence-writing-tools-for-windows-get-new-summarization-features-and-more/), [Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/can-apple-catch-up-apple-intelligence-just-shipped-yet-free-apple-writing-tools-on-github-for-windows-and-linux-make-a-better-alternative)...).

Writing Tools was also among the üî• [**top 10 most trending AI programs in the world**](https://devface.ai/ranking/top_ai_developers/2024-10) on GitHub in October 2024.

Hi! I'm Jesai, a high school student from Bangalore, and I created and maintain Writing Tools with help from our [amazing contributors](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/edit/main/README.md#-contributors). I want to especially shout out [momokrono](https://github.com/momokrono), who's contributed extensively, and [Arya Mirsepasi](https://github.com/Aryamirsepasi), who built the entire macOS port!

Writing Tools will always remain completely free and open-source.

If you find value in it, it would mean the world to me if you could support us as we continue to improve it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## ‚ö° What can I do with Writing Tools, exactly?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hyper-intelligent Writing Tools:
- Select _any_ text on your PC and invoke Writing Tools with `ctrl+space`.
- Choose **Proofread**, **Rewrite**, **Friendly**, **Professional**, **Concise**, or even enter **custom instructions** (e.g., _"add comments to this code"_, _"make it title case"_, _"translate to French"_).
- Your text will instantly be replaced with the AI-optimized version. Use `ctrl+z` to revert.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Powerful content summarization that you can chat with:
- Select all text in any webpage, document, email, etc., with `ctrl+a`, or select the transcript of a YouTube video (from its description).
- Choose **Summary**, **Key Points**, or **Table** after invoking Writing Tools.
- Get a pop-up summary with clear and beautiful formatting (with Markdown rendering), saving you hours.
- Chat with the summary if you'd like to learn more or have questions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Go wild with your own buttons!
- They're your own magic buttons. Dream, and it'll magically be done with AI.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Chat with an LLM anytime in a click:
- Press `ctrl+space` without selecting text to start a conversation with your LLM _(for privacy, chat history is deleted when you close the window)_.

## üåü Why Choose Writing Tools?

Aside from being the only Windows/Linux program like Apple's Writing Tools, and the only way to use them on an Intel Mac or in the EU:

- **More intelligent than Apple's Writing Tools and Grammarly Premium:** Apple uses a tiny 3B parameter model, while Writing Tools lets you use much more advanced models for free (e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash [~30B]). Grammarly's rule-based NLP can't compete with LLMs.
- **Completely free and open-source:** No subscriptions or hidden costs. Bloat-free and uses **~0% of your CPU** even when actively using it.
- **Versatile AI LLM support:** Jump in quickly with the **free Gemini API & Gemini 2.0**, or an extensive range of **local LLMs** (via Ollama [[instructions]](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools?tab=readme-ov-file#-optional-ollama-local-llm-instructions-for-windowslinux-v7-onwards), llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, TabbyAPI, vLLM, etc.) or **cloud-based LLMs** (ChatGPT, Mistral AI, etc.) through Writing Tools' OpenAI-API-compatibility.
- **Does not mess with your clipboard, and works system-wide.**
- **Privacy-focused**: Your API key and config files stay on *your* device. NO logging, diagnostic collection, tracking, or ads. Invoked *only* on your command. Local LLMs keep your data on your device & work without the internet.
- **Supports multiple languages:** Works with any language and translates text better than Google Translate (type "translate to [language]" in `Describe your change...`).
- **Code support:** Fix, improve, translate, or add comments to code with `Describe your change...`."
- **Themes, Dark Mode, & Customization**: Choose between **2 themes**: a blurry gradient theme and a plain theme that resembles the Windows + V pop-up! Also has full **dark mode** support. **Set your own hotkey** for quick access.

## ‚úÖ **1 Minute Installation**

### **ü™ü Windows**:
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest `Writing.Tools.zip` file.
2. Extract it to your desired location (recommended: `Documents` or `App Data/Local`), run `Writing Tools.exe`, and enjoy! :D

*Note: Writing Tools is a portable app. If you extract it into a protected folder (e.g., Program Files), you must run it as administrator at least on first launch so it can create/edit its config files (in the same folder as its exe).*

**PS: Go to Writing Tools' Settings (from its tray icon at the bottom right of the taskbar) to enable starting Writing Tools on boot.**

### **üêß Linux (work-in-progress)**:
[Run it from the source code](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/blob/8713e5a5de63a7892b05a43b9753172e692768fb/README's%20Linked%20Content/To%20Run%20Writing%20Tools%20Directly%20from%20the%20Source%20Code.md)

Writing Tools works well on x11. On Wayland, there are a few caveats:
- [it works on XWayland apps](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/issues/34#issuecomment-2461633556)
- [and it works if you disable Wayland for individual Flatpaks with Flatseal.](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/issues/93#issuecomment-2576511041)

<a id="macos"></a>
### üçé macOS
The macOS version is a **native Swift port**, developed by [Arya Mirsepasi](https://github.com/Aryamirsepasi). View the [README inside the macOS folder](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/tree/main/macOS) to learn more.

To install it:
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest macOS `.dmg` file.
2. Open the `.dmg` file, also open a Finder Window, and drag the `writing-tools.app` into the Applications folder. That's it!

**Note:** macOS 14 or later is required due to accessibility API requirements.

#### üíé Why the macOS port is special

- **Truly native**: Built in Swift (SwiftUI + AppKit where needed) for a fast, polished Mac experience.
- **Private & on-device**: Run **local LLMs with MLX** on Apple Silicon ‚Äî no internet required for on-device models.
- **Rich-text aware**: **Proofread preserves RTF formatting** (bold, italics, lists, links) so your documents keep their look while errors disappear.
- **Your workflows, your way**: **Edit and add your own commands** and assign custom shortcuts.
- **Multilingual by design**: App UI supports **English, German, French, and Spanish**, and commands work in many more languages.
- **Choice of intelligence**: Connect to top providers or go fully local ‚Äî switch any time.
- **Themes**: Multiple themes (including dark mode) to match your desktop vibe.

#### üß† Providers & Models on macOS

- Cloud: **OpenAI, Google (Gemini), Anthropic, Mistral, OpenRouter**  
- Local: **Ollama** (via OpenAI-compatible endpoint) and **MLX on Apple Silicon** for first-class, low-latency on-device inference  
- You can mix & match: keep sensitive work on-device with MLX, use cloud models when you need the biggest brains.

#### üñ±Ô∏è System-wide magic on macOS

- Works across most Mac apps ‚Äî select text, invoke Writing Tools, and instantly **Proofread**, **Rewrite**, **Change tone**, or **Summarize**.
- Start a **quick chat** with your chosen model without selecting text.

> **Tip:** If your shortcut clashes with Spotlight or Input Source switching, set a custom hotkey in Writing Tools **and/or** adjust macOS settings under  
> **System Settings ‚Üí Keyboard ‚Üí Keyboard Shortcuts** (Spotlight / Input Sources).

#### üîê First-launch permissions (macOS)

For full functionality, macOS will prompt you to grant:
- **Accessibility** (to read/replace selected text)
- **Screen Recording** (for certain apps that restrict text access)

You can manage these under **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security**.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Power features (macOS)

- **Command editor**: Create reusable buttons for your own prompts and assign shortcuts.
- **Model flexibility**: Bring your own API keys. Switch providers per task.
- **Document-friendly**: RTF-preserving **Proofread** keeps your formatting intact.
- **Localization**: UI in **EN/DE/FR/ES**; commands happily work with many languages.
- **Theming**: Choose from multiple themes, including dark mode.

#### üß© Troubleshooting (macOS)

- **Hotkey not firing?** Change the shortcut in Writing Tools and make sure nothing else uses the same combo (Spotlight / Input Sources).  
- **No text replacement in a specific app?** Ensure **Accessibility** is enabled for Writing Tools; for some apps, **Screen Recording** is also required.  
- **Local model issues?** Confirm your Ollama/MLX model is running and the base URL/model name are correct in Settings.

## üëÄ Tips

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Summarise a YouTube video from its transcript:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd4780d4-7cdb-4bdb-9a64-e93520ab61be

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make Writing Tools work better in MS Word: the `ctrl+space` keyboard shortcut is mapped to "Clear Formatting", making you lose paragraph indentation. Here's how to improve this:
P.S.: Word's rich-text formatting (bold, italics, underline, colours...) will be lost on using Writing Tools. A Markdown editor such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has no such issue.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42a3d8c7-18ac-4282-9478-16aab935f35e

## üîí Privacy

I believe strongly in protecting your privacy. Writing Tools:
- Does not collect or store any of your writing data by itself. It doesn't even collect general logs, so it's super light and privacy-friendly.
- Lets you use local LLMs to process your text entirely on-device.
- Only sends text to the chosen AI provider (encrypted) when you *explicitly* use one of the options.
- Only stores your API key locally on your device.

Note: If you choose to use a cloud based LLM, refer to the AI provider's privacy policy and terms of service.

## ‚ú® Options Explained

- **Proofread:** The smartest grammar & spelling corrector. Sorry not sorry, Grammarly Premium.
- **Rewrite:** Improve the phrasing of your text.
- **Make Friendly/Professional:** Adjust the tone of your text.
- **Custom Instructions:** Tailor your request (e.g., "Translate to French") through `Describe your change...`.

The following options respond in a pop-up window (with markdown rendering, selectable text, and a zoom level that saves & applies on app restarts):
- **Summarize:** Create clear and concise summaries.
- **Extract Key Points:** Highlight the most important points.
- **Create Tables:** Convert text into a formatted table. PS: You can copy & paste the table into MS Word.

## ü¶ô (Optional) Ollama Local LLM Instructions [for Windows/Linux v7 onwards]:
These instructions are for Writing Tools Windows/Linux v7+, using its native Ollama provider:
1. [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and install Ollama.
2. Choose an LLM from [here](https://ollama.com/library). Recommended: `Llama 3.1 8B` (~8GB RAM of VRAM required).
3. Run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` in your terminal to download it.
4. Open Writing Tools Settings and simply select the Ollama AI Provider. The default model name is already `Llama 3.1 8B`.
5. That's it! **Enjoy Writing Tools with _absolute_ privacy and no internet connection!** üéâ From now on, you'll simply need to launch Ollama and Writing Tools into the background for it to work.

## ü¶ô (Optional) Ollama Local LLM Instructions:
These instructions are for any Writing Tools version, using the OpenAI-Compatible provider:
1. [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and install Ollama.
2. Choose an LLM from [here](https://ollama.com/library). Recommended: `Llama 3.1 8B` (~8GB RAM of VRAM/RAM required).
3. Run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` in your terminal to download Llama 3.1.
4. In Writing Tools, set the `OpenAI-Compatible` provider with:
   - API Key: `ollama` (PS: For most local LLM providers, any random string here will suffice.)
   - API Base URL: `http://localhost:11434/v1`
   - API Model: `llama3.1:8b`
5. That's it! **Enjoy Writing Tools with _absolute_ privacy and no internet connection!** üéâ From now on, you'll simply need to launch Ollama and Writing Tools into the background for it to work.

## üêû Known Issues
1. (Being investigated) On some devices, Writing Tools does not work correctly with the default hotkey.
   
   To fix it, simply change the hotkey to **ctrl+`** or **ctrl+j** and restart Writing Tools. PS: If a hotkey is already in use by a program or background process, Writing Tools may not be able to intercept it. The above hotkeys are usually unused.

2. The initial launch of the `Writing Tools.exe` might take unusually long ‚Äî this seems to be because AV software extensively scans this new executable before letting it run. Once it launches into the background in RAM, it works instantly as usual.
