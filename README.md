## ✨ What is Writing Tools?

Writing Tools is an **Apple Intelligence-inspired application for Windows, Linux, and macOS that supercharges your writing with an AI LLM** (cloud-based or local).

With one hotkey press system-wide, it lets you fix grammar, optimize text according to your instructions, summarize content (webpages, YouTube videos, etc.), and more.

It's currently the **world's most intelligent system-wide grammar assistant**, works in ~any language, and has been featured in 🔥 [**28+ global publications**](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/blob/main/Media%20Coverage.md) ([Beebom](https://beebom.com/high-schooler-app-brings-apple-inteligence-writing-tools-windows/), [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-pc-can-now-deliver-instant-free-writing-help-across-all-apps/), [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/if-you-like-apple-intelligences-writing-tool-try-this-open-source-app-as-its-windows-counterpart/), [Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-intelligence-writing-tools-for-windows-get-new-summarization-features-and-more/), [Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/can-apple-catch-up-apple-intelligence-just-shipped-yet-free-apple-writing-tools-on-github-for-windows-and-linux-make-a-better-alternative)...).

Writing Tools was also among the 🔥 [**top 10 most trending AI programs in the world**](https://devface.ai/ranking/top_ai_developers/2024-10) on GitHub in October 2024.

Hi! I'm Jesai, a high school student from Bangalore, and I created and maintain Writing Tools with help from our [amazing contributors](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/edit/main/README.md#-contributors). I want to especially shout out [momokrono](https://github.com/momokrono), who's contributed extensively, and [Arya Mirsepasi](https://github.com/Aryamirsepasi), who built the entire macOS port!

Writing Tools will always remain completely free and open-source.

If you find value in it, it would mean the world to me if you could support us as we continue to improve it. ❤️

## ⚡ What can I do with Writing Tools, exactly?

### 1️⃣ Hyper-intelligent Writing Tools:
- Select _any_ text on your PC and invoke Writing Tools with `ctrl+space`.
- Choose **Proofread**, **Rewrite**, **Friendly**, **Professional**, **Concise**, or even enter **custom instructions** (e.g., _"add comments to this code"_, _"make it title case"_, _"translate to French"_).
- Your text will instantly be replaced with the AI-optimized version. Use `ctrl+z` to revert.

### 2️⃣ Powerful content summarization that you can chat with:
- Select all text in any webpage, document, email, etc., with `ctrl+a`, or select the transcript of a YouTube video (from its description).
- Choose **Summary**, **Key Points**, or **Table** after invoking Writing Tools.
- Get a pop-up summary with clear and beautiful formatting (with Markdown rendering), saving you hours.
- Chat with the summary if you'd like to learn more or have questions.

### 3️⃣ Go wild with your own buttons!
- They're your own magic buttons. Dream, and it'll magically be done with AI.

### 3️⃣ Chat with an LLM anytime in a click:
- Press `ctrl+space` without selecting text to start a conversation with your LLM _(for privacy, chat history is deleted when you close the window)_.

## 🌟 Why Choose Writing Tools?

Aside from being the only Windows/Linux program like Apple's Writing Tools, and the only way to use them on an Intel Mac or in the EU:

- **More intelligent than Apple's Writing Tools and Grammarly Premium:** Apple uses a tiny 3B parameter model, while Writing Tools lets you use much more advanced models for free (e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash [~30B]). Grammarly's rule-based NLP can't compete with LLMs.
- **Completely free and open-source:** No subscriptions or hidden costs. Bloat-free and uses **~0% of your CPU** even when actively using it.
- **Versatile AI LLM support:** Jump in quickly with the **free Gemini API & Gemini 2.0**, or an extensive range of **local LLMs** (via Ollama [[instructions]](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools?tab=readme-ov-file#-optional-ollama-local-llm-instructions-for-windowslinux-v7-onwards), llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, TabbyAPI, vLLM, etc.) or **cloud-based LLMs** (ChatGPT, Mistral AI, etc.) through Writing Tools' OpenAI-API-compatibility.
- **Does not mess with your clipboard, and works system-wide.**
- **Privacy-focused**: Your API key and config files stay on *your* device. NO logging, diagnostic collection, tracking, or ads. Invoked *only* on your command. Local LLMs keep your data on your device & work without the internet.
- **Supports multiple languages:** Works with any language and translates text better than Google Translate (type "translate to [language]" in `Describe your change...`).
- **Code support:** Fix, improve, translate, or add comments to code with `Describe your change...`."
- **Themes, Dark Mode, & Customization**: Choose between **2 themes**: a blurry gradient theme and a plain theme that resembles the Windows + V pop-up! Also has full **dark mode** support. **Set your own hotkey** for quick access.

## ✅ **1 Minute Installation**

### **🪟 Windows**:
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest `Writing.Tools.zip` file.
2. Extract it to your desired location (recommended: `Documents` or `App Data/Local`), run `Writing Tools.exe`, and enjoy! :D

*Note: Writing Tools is a portable app. If you extract it into a protected folder (e.g., Program Files), you must run it as administrator at least on first launch so it can create/edit its config files (in the same folder as its exe).*

**PS: Go to Writing Tools' Settings (from its tray icon at the bottom right of the taskbar) to enable starting Writing Tools on boot.**

### **🐧 Linux (work-in-progress)**:
[Run it from the source code](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/blob/8713e5a5de63a7892b05a43b9753172e692768fb/README's%20Linked%20Content/To%20Run%20Writing%20Tools%20Directly%20from%20the%20Source%20Code.md)

Writing Tools works well on x11. On Wayland, there are a few caveats:
- [it works on XWayland apps](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/issues/34#issuecomment-2461633556)
- [and it works if you disable Wayland for individual Flatpaks with Flatseal.](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/issues/93#issuecomment-2576511041)

### **🍎 macOS**:
The macOS version is a **native Swift port**, developed by [Arya Mirsepasi](https://github.com/Aryamirsepasi). View the [README inside the macOS folder](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/tree/main/macOS) to learn more.

To install it:
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest macOS `.dmg` file.
2. Open the `.dmg` file, also open a Finder Window, and drag the `writing-tools.app` into the Applications folder. That's it!

**Note:** macOS 14 or later is required due to accessibility API requirements.

## 👀 Tips

#### 1️⃣ Summarise a YouTube video from its transcript:

#### 2️⃣ Make Writing Tools work better in MS Word: the `ctrl+space` keyboard shortcut is mapped to "Clear Formatting", making you lose paragraph indentation. Here's how to improve this:
P.S.: Word's rich-text formatting (bold, italics, underline, colours...) will be lost on using Writing Tools. A Markdown editor such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has no such issue.

## 🔒 Privacy

I believe strongly in protecting your privacy. Writing Tools:
- Does not collect or store any of your writing data by itself. It doesn't even collect general logs, so it's super light and privacy-friendly.
- Lets you use local LLMs to process your text entirely on-device.
- Only sends text to the chosen AI provider (encrypted) when you *explicitly* use one of the options.
- Only stores your API key locally on your device.

Note: If you choose to use a cloud based LLM, refer to the AI provider's privacy policy and terms of service.

## ✨ Options Explained

- **Proofread:** The smartest grammar & spelling corrector. Sorry not sorry, Grammarly Premium.
- **Rewrite:** Improve the phrasing of your text.
- **Make Friendly/Professional:** Adjust the tone of your text.
- **Custom Instructions:** Tailor your request (e.g., "Translate to French") through `Describe your change...`.

The following options respond in a pop-up window (with markdown rendering, selectable text, and a zoom level that saves & applies on app restarts):
- **Summarize:** Create clear and concise summaries.
- **Extract Key Points:** Highlight the most important points.
- **Create Tables:** Convert text into a formatted table. PS: You can copy & paste the table into MS Word.

## 🦙 (Optional) Ollama Local LLM Instructions [for Windows/Linux v7 onwards]:
These instructions are for Writing Tools Windows/Linux v7+, using its native Ollama provider:
1. [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and install Ollama.
2. Choose an LLM from [here](https://ollama.com/library). Recommended: `Llama 3.1 8B` (~8GB RAM of VRAM required).
3. Run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` in your terminal to download it.
4. Open Writing Tools Settings and simply select the Ollama AI Provider. The default model name is already `Llama 3.1 8B`.
5. That's it! **Enjoy Writing Tools with _absolute_ privacy and no internet connection!** 🎉 From now on, you'll simply need to launch Ollama and Writing Tools into the background for it to work.

## 🦙 (Optional) Ollama Local LLM Instructions:
These instructions are for any Writing Tools version, using the OpenAI-Compatible provider:
1. [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and install Ollama.
2. Choose an LLM from [here](https://ollama.com/library). Recommended: `Llama 3.1 8B` (~8GB RAM of VRAM/RAM required).
3. Run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` in your terminal to download Llama 3.1.
4. In Writing Tools, set the `OpenAI-Compatible` provider with:
   - API Key: `ollama` (PS: For most local LLM providers, any random string here will suffice.)
   - API Base URL: `http://localhost:11434/v1`
   - API Model: `llama3.1:8b`
5. That's it! **Enjoy Writing Tools with _absolute_ privacy and no internet connection!** 🎉 From now on, you'll simply need to launch Ollama and Writing Tools into the background for it to work.

## 🐞 Known Issues
1. (Being investigated) On some devices, Writing Tools does not work correctly with the default hotkey.
   
   To fix it, simply change the hotkey to **ctrl+`** or **ctrl+j** and restart Writing Tools. PS: If a hotkey is already in use by a program or background process, Writing Tools may not be able to intercept it. The above hotkeys are usually unused.

2. The initial launch of the `Writing Tools.exe` might take unusually long — this seems to be because AV software extensively scans this new executable before letting it run. Once it launches into the background in RAM, it works instantly as usual.
